Delwink prefix tree (trie) library

What's this for?
----------------

This was written for use with Delwink's LiberTI encoder to find keywords in
source lines, but it is a fairly standard implementation of the
well-established "trie" structure, also called a prefix tree.

The purpose of a trie structure is to function as an efficient dictionary
registry. New words are added to the dictionary, and the dictionary is searched
one letter at a time to find the quickest route to the end of the desired word,
as opposed to checking string equality for each string in the dictionary which
is slow and inefficient on the CPU. Trie structures can be more memory
efficient that a static string dictionary as well, because any words that share
the same starting characters (prefix) will share the same memory for those
characters. This does come at a cost for dictionaries with words that are
nothing alike, because each character in the dictionary is more than 1 byte (32
bytes each on my implementation) since it must keep track of what characters
are adjacent to it, and this implementation of the structure allows storage of
one integer as data for complete words (used in LiberTI's encoder to determine
which token to replace the keyword with).

Many implementations of this structure exist, but this is Delwink's preferred
implementation since it follows Delwink's standards and development styles.

Build
-----

You'll need a C compiler, the GNU Autotools, and libtool. On Debian-based
systems, you can get these with:

    # apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf libtool

libpfxtree uses the GNU build process. You can compile it with the following
steps:

    $ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make

Install
-------

After building (see above), you can install the library with this:

    # make install

Hacking
-------

libpfxtree uses the GNU coding style for C and follows a strict 79-column limit
in its source code. Indentations are two spaces, and tab characters are eight
spaces. It is polite to use a tab character any time eight spaces would be used
to indent, but it is not required.
